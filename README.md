# MaRDA Metadata Extractors: Schema

A repository containing the [LinkML](https://linkml.io/linkml/)-based schemas backing the
MaRDA Metadata Extractors [Registry](https://github.com/marda-alliance/metadata_extractors_registry/)
and [API](https://github.com/marda-alliance/metadata_extractors_api/).

The schemas implemented here are machine-actionable. They are used by the [Registry](https://github.com/marda-alliance/metadata_extractors_registry/) to validate entries; a reference implementation demonstrating
their pracical use is shown in the [API](https://github.com/marda-alliance/metadata_extractors_api/).

## Contents
The repository contains two user-facing schemas:

- ``FileType`` schema, used to specify the types of files passed to the extractors by users.
  The schema definition is located in [``filetype.yml``](./schemas/filetype.yml).

- ``Extractor`` schema, used to specify the download, installation, and usage instructions,
  allowing for machine execution of the defined extractor/parser code, as well as a list of
  ``FileTypes`` compatible with the ``Extractor``.
  The schema definition is located in [``extractor.yml``](./schemas/extractor.yml).

## Usage
### Validation
The schema definitions contained in this repository can be used to locally validate your own
``FileTypes`` and ``Extractors``. Several examples are provided for this purpose in the
[``examples`` folder](./examples/).

To get started, first make sure LinkML is installed in your python environment. You may use
the provided ``requirements.txt`` file for this purpose:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, you can check the validity of your filetype or extractor definition against the provided
schemas using ``linkml-validate``. For example, to validate the provided example filetype definition
in [``biologic_mpr.yml``](./examples/filetype/biologic_mpr.yml) against the ``FileType`` schema
from ``schemas/filetype.yml``, run:

```
linkml-validate -s schemas/filetype.yml -C FileType examples/filetype/biologic_mpr.yml
```

If successful, you should see "``âœ“ No problems found``" returned by ``linkml-validate``.

### Translation

The LinkML schemas provided here can be automatically translated to other formats, including
JSONSchema, Python dataclasses, or Pydantic classes:

```
gen-json-schema schemas/filetype.yml >> filetype.json
gen-python schemas/filetype.yml >> filetype.py
gen-pydantic schemas/filetype.yml >> filetype.py
```

The generated files can be used in downstream codes such as in the [validation function](https://github.com/marda-alliance/metadata_extractors_registry/blob/main/tasks.py#L33)
of the [MaRDA Metadata Extractors Registry](https://github.com/marda-alliance/metadata_extractors_registry).
