# Enum: UsageScope




_This enumeration specifies the scope of extraction performed by the `Extractor`._



## Comments

* Currently allows the `Extractor->usage` to be described in one of two modes, `meta-only` and `meta+data`.
* In practice, this means that extractors may have multiple defined usage modes for each `UsageScope` and each `UsageType`.
* The default is to assume the 'worst case', i.e. that the `Extractor` returns as much of the data in the input file as it supports, plus potentially additional analysis.

URI: [UsageScope](UsageScope)

## Permissible Values

| Value | Description | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| meta-only | This usage scope only returns metadata associated with the file, with the<br/>interpretation of "metadata" left up to the `Extractor`. | This may include, but is not limited to:<br/>  - timestamps,<br/>  - column headings,<br/>  - data types, and<br/>  - data shapes. The size of data returned in this mode should be limited and<br/>will typically be much smaller than the file size. This metadata SHOULD be<br/>expressed as a JSON-serializable document that can, for example, be loaded into<br/>Python with only standard library imports. |
| meta+data | This usage scope refers to a "full" extraction of the file, whereby the<br/>extractor tries to faithfully interpret and return all supported information<br/>contained within the file. | This may include, but is not limited to:<br/>  - binary data,<br/>  - large multi-dimensional arrays,<br/>  - plus all of the associated metadata from a `meta-only` extraction. The size<br/>of the data returned in this mode is not limited and could be significantly<br/>larger than the input file size (in the case of binary data, or additional<br/>analysis being performed upon extraction). |
