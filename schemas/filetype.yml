    This file describes the `FileType` model created by the MaRDA extractors WG.


classes:
    FileType:
        description: >-
            A specific encoding of data for storage purposes, defined by a set of
            common characteristics and expectations, that can be assumed for all files
            of a given file type.

                description: >-
                    If this file type is associated with particular software or instrument
                    vendors, they can be listed here.
            associated_instruments:
                multivalued: true
                description: >-
                    Any instrument, or class of instruments, that typically create
                    the data encoded into such files.
            associated_software:
                multivalued: true
                description: >-
                    Any software (proprietary or otherwise) that produces such files.

                multivalued: true
                range: FileType
                description: >-
                    If this format uses any particular underlying generic formats,
                    e.g., CSV, JSON, HDF5, then they can be listed here.
            mimetypes:
                multivalued: true
                description: >-
                    The mimetypes of the file-format or used `based_formats`.

                multivalued: true
                description: >-
                    If this is a subformat that follows a particular well-defined
                    standard, e.g., CIF, NeXus, then it can be listed here.
            file_names:
                multivalued: true
                description: >-
                    Regular expressions that describe the typecal filenames that might be used
                    for this format. This could target file-extensions for example.
    TextFileType:
        is_a: FileType
        description: >-
            A specific file type that is based on ASCII text.
        attributes:
            contents:
                description:
                    A regular expression that allows to identify a file of this type,
                    based on its full contents or partial content (e.g. a file header)
    StructuredDataFileType:
        is_a: FileType
        description: >-
            A specific file type based on a base format that support structured data object, such as JSON or HDF5.
        attributes:
            characteristic_keys:
                description:
                    A list of keys that are indicative for the top level object in data of this type.

                description:
                    A list of key value pairs that are indicative for the top level object in data of this type.
            query:
                description:
                    A query written in a to be choosed language (e.g. xpath) to describe some expected contents of
