    This file describes the `Extractor` model created by the MaRDA extractors WG.


classes:
    Extractor:
        description: >-
            A script, code, or web service that, when executed, can extract information
            from a supplied "file" with a specific [`FileType`](FileType.md). The
            supplied "file" may also be a set of files with a given structure. The
            extracted information may be verbatim or transformed, and include the
            scientific data and/or metadata contained within the file.

                required: true
                range: SupportedFileType
                description: >-
                    An enumeration of the `FileType` that an `Extractor` supports,
                    matching `FileTypes` present in the registry. The `FileType->id`
                    slot can be passed to the `Extractor`, [see the `Usage` class](Usage.md).
            supported_output_filetypes:
                multivalued: true
                required: false
                range: SupportedFileType
                description: >-
                    An enumeration of the possible output formats of an `Extractor`.
                    These should match `FileTypes` present in the registry. They can
                    be specified on extractor execution using the templates described
                    in the `Extractor->Usage->command` slot, [see the `Usage` class](Usage.md).
            source_repository:
                description: >-
                    A URL or URI for a source code repository associated with this
                    extractor.
            documentation:
                description: >-
                    A URL or URI for any online documentation associated with this
                    extractor.

                description: >-
                    A machine-actionable instructions for the usage of the Extractor.
                    The described usage pattern shall be available after the instructions
                    specified in `Extractor->installation` slot have been followed.

                multivalued: true

                range: Installation
                description: >-
                    A machine-actionable set of installation instructions to obtain
                    a working set-up of the `Extractor`.
            instructions:
                description: >-
                    Any human-readable usage notes or installation instructions for
                    this `Extractor`. This field is intended for human use only and
                    is not intended to be machine-actionable. Please use the `Extractor->installation`
                    and `Extractor->usage` slots for that purpose.
